# Simon-Says-Game
A responsive game of Simon Says made from HTML, CSS, and JS (DOM). 

The user can start the game with the press of any key. Then buttons flash and the user has to repeat the exact pattern in order while repeating the previous patters to keep leveling up. If the user presses the wrong button by any chance, the game will stop and the score will be displayed.
